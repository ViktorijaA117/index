            <h2>About me</h2>
            <time datetime="2024-06-21">June 21, 2024</time>
            <p>My name is Victoria Alagjozvska. I'm a 20-year-old student from Berovo, a place known for its serene landscapes and warm community. Life in Berovo has always been peaceful and nurturing, surrounded by nature's beauty and the simplicity of small-town living.</p>
            <p>As I embarked on a new chapter of my life, I moved to Skopje to pursue higher education. I am currently in my first year of college, an exciting journey filled with new experiences and endless opportunities for growth and learning. The bustling city of Skopje, with its vibrant culture and dynamic atmosphere, has been a significant change from the quiet charm of Berovo. <br>Yet, this contrast has enriched my life, broadening my horizons and helping me adapt to new challenges.</p>
            <p>However, as I transitioned to Skopje for higher education, I encountered a dynamic and vibrant cityscape that starkly contrasted with the tranquility of Berovo. Skopje greeted me with its bustling streets, diverse cultural tapestry, and a sense of boundless energy that permeates every corner. The city's rich history, reflected in its architecture and public spaces, adds a layer of depth to my everyday experiences here. Living in Skopje has not only expanded my academic horizons but also allowed me to immerse myself in a new and exciting lifestyle, fostering personal growth and a deeper understanding of the world around me.</p>
